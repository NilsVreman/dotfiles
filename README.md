# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a
Python, Java, Ruby, Matlab or Bash programmer you might find something useful
here.

## Installation

```
    bash installation.sh
```

This symlinks the dotfiles, folders, and files into your home folder.


## ToDo
* Fix Installation script

### Fixed
* ~Added snippets correctly~
* ~Installed Plugins correctly~
