# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a:

- Rust,
- Python,
- Lua, or
- Bash programmer

you might find something useful here.

## Installation

```
    sh setup.sh
```

This symlinks the dotfiles, folders, and files into your home folder and backups the old ones to a folder `$HOME/backup`.

## Dependencies

To be installed before doing anything else:

- `npm`
- `neovim`
- `ripgrep`
- `zoxide`
- `fd-find`
