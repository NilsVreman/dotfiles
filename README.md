# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a
Python, Java, Ruby, Matlab or Bash programmer you might find something useful
here.

## Installation

```
    bash install.sh
```

This symlinks the dotfiles, folders, and files into your home folder.

## NOTE

Currently the installation script is not available.
