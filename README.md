# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a
Python, Java, Ruby, Matlab or Bash programmer you might find something useful
here.

## Installation

```
    sh setup.sh
```

This symlinks the dotfiles, folders, and files into your home folder and
installs all important packages in vim using vundle.

## ToDo

### Fixed
* ~Fix Installation script~
* ~Added snippets correctly~
* ~Installed Plugins correctly~
* ~Linking of snippets not correct.~
