# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a
Rust, Python, Julia, C, Lua, or Bash programmer you might find something useful
here.

## Installation

```
    sh setup.sh
```

This symlinks the dotfiles, folders, and files into your home folder.
To install the vim plugins, there are some extra steps that I'll have to upload at some point

### NeoVim Installation:
__TODO__
